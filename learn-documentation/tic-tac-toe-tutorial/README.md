# Tic-Tac-Toe Game: A Simple Introduction to React

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game that serves as an introduction to React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Introduction

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three marks (either "X" or "O").

## Tutorial Overview

This tutorial will guide you through building a Tic-Tac-Toe game using React.js. By following along, you'll learn the fundamentals of React, including components, state management, and event handling.

## Getting Started

To get started, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Tutorial Steps

1. **Setting Up the Project**: We'll create a new React project using `create-react-app` and set up the basic folder structure.

2. **Building the Board Component**: We'll create a `Board` component that represents the game board and contains the logic for rendering the grid and handling user clicks.

3. **Adding Game Logic**: We'll implement the game logic to determine the winner and handle the game state.

4. **Completing the Tutorial**: Finally, we'll add finishing touches to the game, such as displaying the winner and allowing players to restart the game.
